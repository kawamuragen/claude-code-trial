# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Japanese stock price analysis web application (株価分析アプリ) that provides real-time stock data visualization and technical analysis. The application is currently a single HTML file that references external CSS and JavaScript files.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main application HTML file with Japanese interface
- `styles.css` - CSS styling (referenced but not present)  
- `script.js` - JavaScript application logic (referenced but not present)

## Key Features

The application includes:
- Stock symbol search functionality
- Real-time price display with change indicators
- Interactive price chart using Chart.js
- Basic statistics display (high, low, volume)
- Technical indicators (20-day MA, 50-day MA, RSI)
- Multiple data sources:
  - Yahoo Finance API (free, real-time data via CORS proxy)
  - Alpha Vantage API (requires API key)
  - Demo data for testing
- 5-minute caching system to reduce API requests
- API source selection (Yahoo Finance / Demo data)

## Development Notes

- The HTML references Chart.js CDN for charting functionality
- Application interface is in Japanese
- Uses allorigins.win as CORS proxy to access Yahoo Finance API
- Implements client-side caching to minimize API requests
- Falls back to demo data if real API fails
- No build process or package management currently configured
- All files are now present and functional
